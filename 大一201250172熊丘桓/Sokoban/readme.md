The application is generated by C++ language , the source file is `Sokoban.cpp`.

##### How to Play

Under the content, `map1.txt`, `map2.txt` and`map3.txt`denote the three maps commanded, describing the initial map with five kinds of symbol. Specially, `_`denotes a vacant area, `#` the wall, `$` the initial place of a box, `&` the final goal to place the boxes and `@` the poor Sokoban.

At each case, `WASD`  and $\uparrow\downarrow\leftarrow\rightarrow$  are used to control the Sokoban to move. The concrete code of game can e referred in `C位出道“线上比赛题目说明.pdf`. Besides, `R` is set to use to **restart** the current case. To make the game easier, `Z` is designed to **skip** the current case.

User-defined maps are encouraged. The defined map should be named as the format `mapX.txt`, where X is a number between 1 and 99. All maps in the current content will be showed by the order of X.
